# No Bliggity - No Blog

## Description:
This is an application built to allow user to publish posts/blogs/articles along with any commentary.  I primarily utilized my developing skill sets in express.js, express-handlebars, express-session, mysql and sequelize to create this application.  The application was also deployed to Heroku.  Some of the methods and skills I used are shown below:

* Express.js and sequelize was utilized to start the server and sync it to the mysql database
